- ✅ Intelligent agent selection algorithm with scoring
- ✅ Response formatting for user-friendly output
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (42/42 tests passing)

### 3. ✅ COMPLETED: Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Write unit tests for CommunicationBus
- ✅ Write integration tests for message flow
- ✅ Test adapter process spawning
- ✅ Add test fixtures and mock data
- ✅ Set up Jest configuration properly

### 4. 🎯 NEW: Real Framework Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Test NLI with actual OpenCode binary
- [ ] Test NLI with actual Codex CLI
- [ ] Test multi-agent collaboration workflows
- [ ] Fix remaining 8 integration test failures
- [ ] End-to-end validation of message routing

## Medium Term (Next 2-3 Weeks)

### 5. Persistence Layer 💾
- [ ] Add SQLite/PostgreSQL for message persistence
- [ ] Session persistence across restarts
- [ ] Agent registry persistence
- [ ] Historical metrics storage
- [ ] Advanced configuration management

### 6. Production Readiness 🚀
- [ ] Authentication & security implementation
- [ ] Rate limiting and input validation
- [ ] Advanced health monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Error recovery and circuit breakers
- [ ] Production logging and observability
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup (GitHub Actions)

## Long Term (1-2 Months)

### 7. Advanced Features 🎯
- ✅ Web dashboard for monitoring (Codex - React UI with real-time WebSocket)
  - [ ] Replace mock metrics with `/metrics` API data
  - [ ] Populate agent list/detail from live registry endpoints
  - [ ] Stream real message events via WebSocket and render payload metadata
  - [ ] Feed session monitor/timeline from real workflow endpoints
  - [ ] Wire dashboard controls to administrative APIs (reset, pause/resume)
  - [ ] Persist UI preferences (theme, filters) and finalize responsive/a11y polish
  - [ ] Package dashboard build into deployment pipeline and secure with auth
- [ ] CLI tool for debugging
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests (Docker baseline in place)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting

### 8. ✅ COMPLETED: Ecosystem & Documentation 📚
- ✅ Complete API documentation (Codex - HTTP, WebSocket, message format)
- ✅ Integration guides for each framework (Codex - OpenCode, Codex CLI, Claude Code)
- ✅ Example projects and tutorials (Codex - 4 complete examples)
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides (Codex - comprehensive FAQ)
- ✅ Community contribution guidelines (Codex - CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Technical Debt & Issues 🛠️

**Current Blockers:**
- ✅ ~~TypeScript compilation errors~~ **RESOLVED**
- 🎯 Need actual external tool testing (priority: HIGH)
- 🎯 8 integration tests failing (expected - need real adapters) (priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Missing error handling in process spawning (priority: MEDIUM)

**Architecture Decisions Needed:**
- ✅ ~~Process vs SDK approach for Claude Code~~ **Decided: Process spawning**
- [ ] Persistence strategy (SQLite vs PostgreSQL vs in-memory)
- [ ] Authentication mechanism (JWT vs API keys vs certificates)
- ✅ ~~Deployment strategy~~ **Decided: Docker containers** (Docker baseline complete)

## Resource Requirements

**Development:**
- Node.js 18+ ✅
- TypeScript 5.0+ ✅
- Claude Code CLI (needs testing)
- OpenCode binary (needs testing)
- Codex CLI (needs testing)

**Testing:**
- Jest configuration needed
- Mock processes for unit tests
- Integration test environment
- CI/CD setup

**Production:**
- Database (PostgreSQL recommended)
- Container orchestration
- Monitoring stack
- Load balancing

## Success Metrics

**Week 1 (COMPLETED ✅):**
- ✅ Clean TypeScript compilation (0 errors)
- ✅ Natural Language Interface working (42/42 tests passing)
- ✅ Unit test coverage > 50% (67 tests passing)

**Week 2 (IN PROGRESS 🎯):**
- [ ] All adapters working with real tools
- 🎯 Integration tests passing (8/75 currently failing - expected)
- [ ] Basic persistence implemented

**Month 1:**
- ✅ Docker deployment ready (dev + prod compose files)
- ✅ Documentation complete (API, guides, tutorials, examples)
- [ ] Production-ready deployment with security
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

**Month 2:**
- ✅ Web dashboard implemented (React + WebSocket)
- [ ] Advanced features (persistence, monitoring)
- [ ] Community contributions
- [ ] Real-world usage examples

## Risks & Mitigations

**High Risk:**
- External tool dependencies might not work as expected
  - *Mitigation*: Build comprehensive fallback mechanisms
- TypeScript complexity could slow development
  - *Mitigation*: Keep configs simple, use strict mode selectively

**Medium Risk:**
- Performance at scale unknown
  - *Mitigation*: Early performance testing, optimization sprints
- Security implications of process spawning
  - *Mitigation*: Sandboxing, strict permissions

**Low Risk:**
- API changes in external tools
  - *Mitigation*: Version pinning, abstraction layers
- Community adoption
  - *Mitigation*: Good documentation, examples

# OpenCode Testing Infrastructure Tasks

## Current Status
- Claude agent is fixing TypeScript compilation errors in claude-code-adapter.ts
- Need parallel work on testing infrastructure to prepare for validation

## Testing Infrastructure Tasks

### Phase 1: Test Environment Setup âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create tests/fixtures/ directory structure
- [x] Set up Jest test environment configuration
- [x] Create mock data generators for messages, agents, sessions
- [x] Set up test database configuration (in-memory or test instance)

### Phase 2: Unit Tests (Using Mocks) - IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Write test cases for CommunicationBus core functionality
- [ ] Write test cases for MessageRouter routing logic
- [ ] Write test cases for SessionManager lifecycle
- [ ] Write test cases for ModelSelector strategy patterns
- [ ] Write test cases for ResultAggregator algorithms

### Phase 3: Integration Tests
- [ ] Create integration test framework structure
- [ ] Write adapter integration tests (using mocks initially)
- [ ] Write end-to-end message flow tests
- [ ] Write session management integration tests
- [ ] Write multi-agent orchestration tests

### Phase 4: Test Utilities & Fixtures
- [x] Create test helper utilities
- [x] Create comprehensive test fixtures for all scenarios
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting
- [ ] Create performance test benchmarks

## Notes
- All tests should use mocks initially to avoid conflicts with adapter development
- Focus on testing business logic and message flow
- Tests should be ready to validate Claude's TypeScript fixes
- Use dependency injection patterns to enable easy mocking

## Dependencies
- Waiting for TypeScript compilation errors to be resolved
- Will need actual adapter implementations for final integration tests

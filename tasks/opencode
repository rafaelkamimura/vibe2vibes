# OpenCode Testing Infrastructure Tasks

## Current Status (End of Day - 2025-10-22)
- âœ… COMPLETED: Core testing infrastructure is now functional
- âœ… COMPLETED: Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in claude-code-adapter.ts
- âœ… COMPLETED: Fixed all high-priority test failures (SessionManager, MessageRouter, ModelSelector, ResultAggregator, CommunicationBus)
- âœ… COMPLETED: Docker baseline (Dockerfile + compose) added for agent-communication-bus services
- âœ… COMPLETED: Improved core module implementations (message-router, model-selector, result-aggregator)
- âœ… COMPLETED: Enhanced unit test coverage and assertions
- ðŸ”´ REMAINING: 8 integration test failures need investigation (Phase 2 work)
- ðŸ“‹ Test infrastructure ready for real framework integration testing

## Testing Infrastructure Tasks

### Phase 1: Test Environment Setup âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create tests/fixtures/ directory structure
- [x] Set up Jest test environment configuration
- [x] Create mock data generators for messages, agents, sessions
- [x] Set up test database configuration (in-memory or test instance)

### Phase 2: Unit Tests (Using Mocks) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Write test cases for CommunicationBus core functionality
- [x] Write test cases for MessageRouter routing logic
- [x] Write test cases for SessionManager lifecycle
- [x] Write test cases for ModelSelector strategy patterns
- [x] Write test cases for ResultAggregator algorithms

**Note:** Tests are written but currently failing due to missing implementation methods. This is expected as tests were created to validate the future implementation. The test infrastructure is complete and ready for validation once Claude's TypeScript fixes are complete.

### Phase 3: Integration Tests âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create integration test framework structure
- [x] Write adapter integration tests (using mocks initially)
- [x] Write end-to-end message flow tests
- [x] Write session management integration tests
- [x] Write multi-agent orchestration tests

### Phase 4: Test Utilities & Fixtures âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create test helper utilities
- [x] Create comprehensive test fixtures for all scenarios
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting (deferred to Phase 2)
- [ ] Create performance test benchmarks (deferred to Phase 2)

### Phase 5: Deployment & Containerization âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Add `.dockerignore` for lean build contexts
- [x] Create multi-stage `Dockerfile` (Node 20, non-root, healthcheck)
- [x] Create `docker-compose.yml` for local dev (bus + Postgres + Redis)
- [x] Create `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production baseline
- [ ] Document Docker workflows and environment variables for the team (deferred to documentation phase)

## Tomorrow's Tasks (2025-10-23) - Phase 2: Integration Test Debugging

### Priority 1: Fix Integration Test Failures
- [ ] Investigate 8 failing integration tests in detail
  - Identify root causes (adapter mocking, async issues, type mismatches)
  - Document each failure with reproduction steps
- [ ] Fix adapter integration test failures
  - Review mock implementations in test fixtures
  - Ensure proper async/await handling
- [ ] Fix end-to-end message flow test failures
  - Verify message routing logic with real scenarios
  - Check WebSocket connection handling in tests

### Priority 2: Test Coverage & Reporting
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting with Istanbul/NYC
- [ ] Generate coverage report and identify gaps
- [ ] Add missing test cases for uncovered code paths
- [ ] Target: Achieve 80%+ overall test coverage

### Priority 3: Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Create performance test benchmarks for message throughput
- [ ] Measure routing latency under load
- [ ] Document baseline performance metrics
- [ ] Identify potential bottlenecks for optimization

### Success Criteria
- âœ… All 75 tests passing (0 failures)
- âœ… Test coverage report generated and > 80%
- âœ… Performance benchmarks documented
- âœ… Ready for real framework integration testing

## Notes
- All tests should use mocks initially to avoid conflicts with adapter development
- Focus on testing business logic and message flow
- Tests should be ready to validate Claude's TypeScript fixes
- Use dependency injection patterns to enable easy mocking
- Docker build currently fails until TypeScript compilation errors are resolved (tracked separately)

## Dependencies
- Waiting for TypeScript compilation errors to be resolved
- Will need actual adapter implementations for final integration tests
